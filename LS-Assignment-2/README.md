# LS-Assignment-2

## Context
This is the second assignment of a free mini webdev bootcamp.

The assignment is to recreate a webpage (labeled above as "original image.jpg"). This was assigned with the intention of introducing responsive web design and bootstrap.

## Thoughts
My attempt is above labeled attempt#1.jpg.

I like bootstrap a lot as of now. The documentation is helpful, and a lot can be done using it. The framework makes front-end tasks quick and easy. My only issue with bootstrap comes from the fact that I can tell when a site uses it. I've always wondered why I noticed multiple similarities in sites. Turns out it's due to this framework. 

Nothing wrong with that, especially when content is way more important than then layout of the webpage, but at the same time, it's a little boring to see over and over again. 

That being said, if it works don't fix it. Definitely a useful tool.
